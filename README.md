This is steps to understand the remote and local repository
.
.
first chgange the working directory that you prefer to work
like 'cd c:user/hp/(file name)
.
.
then make a directory in that file using the command prompt 
like 'mkdir (dir name)'
.
.
now the change the working directory by the command 
'cd (dir name)'
.
.
now clone your remote(internet) repository at your github to the local(laptop or pc)
by the command 'git clone (remote repository url)'
.
.
commit a meaage by 'git commit -m "message"'
.
.
after cloning add the file for staging so that it could be committed to push at the next stage
use 'git add .' command for stagging
.
.
now it's time for pushing the file 
by the command 'git push -u origin main' command
.
.
now your file is both at the local and remote repsoitory.
